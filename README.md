> ðŸ˜Ž Everything can be downloaded via Get Apps!

## Introduction

Get Apps is an online service that helps you download applications and resources with a simple link. [Our Blog Posts](https://tech.hxco.de/announcement/to-meet-you-in-one-year.html)

Current Support List: [View https://get.js.org/apps](https://get.js.org/apps "View https://get.js.org/apps")

## Features

- Nice and short url, `https://get.js.org/{appname}`
- Alias available, `https://get.js.org/tg` is the same as `https://get.js.org/telegram`
- Full platform supported, included `Windows` `macOS` `Android` `iOS`
- Always download the latest version of the program
- Optimized code to load quickly across the globe

## How to Use It

### Normal Usage

- Simply enter `https://get.js.org/{appname}` in your browser.

- If you see a `404` error, that means the app you are downloading is not currently supported. Check out [Join In Us](https://github.com/hifocus/get#join-us) page.

- If you see an alert like this:

  ![](https://vip2.loli.io/2022/10/11/naOIQUwPB7qHG16.png)

  Make sure you can access foreign websites normally. This is a feature which can remind users in China Mainland to use proxy when downloading certain restricted apps. If you are not in China Mainland, just ignore this and select `OK`.

- Current Support List: [https://get.js.org/apps](https://get.js.org/apps "View https://get.js.org/apps")

### Alias System

- For English users, our alias system is nice and simple: we don't have much alias. That's because I am a Chinese and not quite sure if `googlechrome` can be abbreviated as `gc`. But if you have any good ideas, please tell us at [Issue](https://github.com/hifocus/get/issue).

- For Chinese users, we create alias for a app in three ways:

  1. Chinese Pinyin in full, like `wangyiyunyinyue`
  2. The first letter of the Pinyin, like `wyyyy`
  3. English translation for the Chinese name, such as `cloudmusic` or `formatfactory`

  These alias above can be available for any Chinese apps. If there are any mistakes, please also let us know at [Issue](https://github.com/hifocus/get/issue).

## How Does It Work

Currently we support more than 50 apps, you may find them in [ https://get.js.org/apps](https://get.js.org/apps "View https://get.js.org/apps").

First Get Apps will identify your OS:

```
<script>
    if (/(x64|WOW64)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        window.location.href = "https://latest.app";
    }
    if (/(x86_64)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        window.location.href = "https://latest.app";
    }
    if (/(Macintosh)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        window.location.href = "https://latest.app";
    }
	// If this app does not support a platform
    if (/(iPhone|iPod)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        alert("This app does not work on your device.");
        }
    if (/(iPad)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        alert("This app does not work on your device.");
    }
    if (/(Android)/i.test(navigator.userAgent)) {
        alert("This app does not work on your device.");
    }
</script>
```

As preperation,  we use the developer tools in Chrome to get download links for specific apps significiant app. For example, the download link for Atom is as follows:

`https://atom.io/download/windows_x64`

This link will automattically redirect you to the the latest stable version of Atom (this one is for Windows 64 bit), which looks like this: 

`https://atom-installer.github.com/v1.28.2/AtomSetup-x64.exe`

Therefore we are able to serve you with the latest version of the app. We can also find permanent links in other ways, such as relying on third-party APIs.
